# Next.js 15 - Unexpected useEffect Behavior and Rapid Counter Increment

This repository demonstrates an unusual issue encountered in a Next.js 15 application. The counter on the '/about' page increments much faster than expected, and the console shows the 'Component mounted' message repeatedly, indicating unexpected re-renders.

## Issue Description

The `/about` page uses the `useEffect` hook to update a counter every second.  However, the counter updates much more frequently than once per second, and the console output shows that the `useEffect` is called multiple times.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
4. Navigate to `/about`.  Observe the rapid counter increment and the repeated console messages.

## Potential Causes (Speculation)

* **Incorrect `useEffect` dependencies:** While the current code uses an empty dependency array `[]`, subtle changes or unexpected re-renders could still trigger the `useEffect` multiple times.
* **Optimization Issues:** Next.js's optimization strategies might be interacting unexpectedly with the interval timer.
* **Data Fetching Conflicts:** Though no data fetching is directly involved, potential underlying issues within Next.js could indirectly trigger additional renders.

## Solution

See the `aboutSolution.js` file for a potential solution. This may involve adjusting the `useEffect` or employing other strategies to prevent the unintended re-renders and ensure that the counter updates at the correct interval.
